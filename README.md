# DLX-Project
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-Stopped-red)

A DLX implementation, realized for the Microelectronics Systems course of Politecnico di Torino. In the *sim* folder there is every vhdl file used for the final implementation. In the *asm* folder there are four assembler programs used to test the DLX. In the *syn* folder there are the script used to synthesize the DLX and the relative reports for area/timing/power. In the *place&route* folder there is the physical implementation of the DLX with the relative parasitics extraction, gate count and timing reports.

## Tools
